# Insert Subtitle Text Here

**Hello world!** I have finally implemented a successful blog for my website. Here's the code:

```java
Blog newBlog = new Blog();
newBlog.append("hello-world.md");
site.append(newBlog);
```

Just kidding, I wish it was that easy.

# Another Subtitle?

I don't know what else to add. Maybe emojis? üßê

I suppose I should test image output. In that case, here's a .gif of [Bongo Cat](https://bongo.cat/).

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/bongocat.gif" alt="Bongo Cat"/>
</div>

See you in the next blog post!
