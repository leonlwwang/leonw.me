## Today is officially my birthday ü•≥

I still can't believe I've turned 21 already. Time really flies as you get older.
And because my birthday just happens to fall under the final day of the year,
I decided to reflect on the most defining experience in my life so far: music production
and songwriting.

# 2012-2015: Skull Music

It all begins ten years ago with a music production software called **Fruity Loops (FL) Studio 10**. I intently watch my friend, Albert, teach himself to produce techno music with YouTube tutorials. I'm fascinated as I see virtual boxes with
random knobs, graphs, and buttons form a bumping techno beat from scratch.

Albert's happy to pique my interest and gives me a copy of the production software. I'd proceed
to make **beautiful** pieces of music &#8211; is what I think in my head as I crank out [ear-wrenching
compositions of noise](https://soundcloud.com/hinighthigh/skull-predator/s-uQvTE?si=b040c942dbc548eba4a9a89a1517c5e6&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing#t=0%3A30). Despite how awful it sounded,
it was crazy to think that me, an 11-year-old fifth grader, created it all from scratch.

I particularly liked making **dubstep**, so I started to interact with the underground scene, which was
essentially a massive Facebook friend circle of aspiring dubstep producers sharing their
gnarliest-sounding basslines and electronic growls.

# 2015-2018: Overdrive

High school starts to kick off and I start to gradually improve my music-making prowess. I decide
that it's time for a grand name change in order to establish a more mature artist brand: **Overdrive!**

This was definitely the peak of my dubstep phase, and my library of sounds and production mastery had
evolved over nearly six years of sound design and exploration. One of the best showcases of this was my
[remix of an old Barely Alive song](https://on.soundcloud.com/sAE4b).

# Hiatus

Unfortunately, as high school continued, good things came to an end.

If you are a music producer, I cannot stress this enough: *BACK UP YOUR SAMPLE/PRESET LIBRARY*. Don't
be like me and have a fried up hard drive with six years of your blood, sweat, and tears down the drain.
To this day I don't exactly know what happened to my laptop, but let's just say that computer viruses: **bad**.

Needless to say, it was hard for me to produce afterwards, and as college was right on the horizon, I
gradually stopped working on projects and Overdrive started to fade away.

# 2021: Enter Night High&#33;

After a difficult couple of years, I finally made it to college. I felt ready to tackle music production once again.

The summer before college began (and the start of COVID üò∑), my childhood friend Steve and I decided
to spend the whole summer recording an entire album. I had recently bought an audio interface and wanted to
record instruments and vocals. That resulted in Campfire, a fun ten-track album where I explored making
indie rock and hip-hop music.

[Campfire](https://open.spotify.com/album/5ZDQcJLSTvNiaNT47m7Yis?si=RWiae2YTRqmfbQ6dCmrpzg) was definitely crude, and my lyrics and voice still make me cringe, but it was a really great
way of rekindling my passion and pivoting into new genres of music. Thus, I rebranded
to **Night High**, a whole new era in my artistry.

In college, I met some super cool and incredibly talented folks at the **UIUC Hip-Hop Collective** (now called
[**Hideout**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7cGbyDXzOndSwgyNSXk7v5)),
and was able to contribute two tracks, [SNAP CRACKLE POP](https://open.spotify.com/track/0XFkXqfaCtoEmO3YDEMbXB?si=018a701df9b64ad9) and [Think About It](https://open.spotify.com/track/7EPHOgLxtvyIyJTIVhXY43?si=ba98b547f6344b1e), to the club's breakout album,
which was an amazing experience!

It was awesome to hear all of the positive feedback from our listeners. Sure,
we might not be topping any charts (...yet üòé), but the community here on campus loves everyone's work and it's truly inspiring.

Finally, this year, I've also released a [few of my own solo tracks](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4GV1B1I84BRLjPMU6DZLut). I can already hear the improvement from
when I first started the artist project! Also really glad I finally bought AutoTune instead of pitch adjusting
individual, sliced clips of my voice. üòÇ

# And so forth&period;&period;&period;

I'm blessed to have made it all the way here with music. As I look back on this decade of ups and downs, I really am proud
of myself for pulling through this far. I can't wait to hear my new sound in 2023!

As my life goes on, there's certainly no guarantee that I'll become a rockstar musician, but wherever things take me, I know that
I will always cherish the gift of musical expression, with or without any audience.

Thank you to everyone who has
supported be through thick and thin, whether you know me as Skull, Overdrive, Night High, or just Leon.

### **Cheers to the future and Happy New Year to all!** ü•Ç
