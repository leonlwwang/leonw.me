### Today is officially my birthday! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰

I still can't believe I've turned 21 already. Time really flies as you get older.
And because my birthday just happens to fall under the final day of the year,
I decided to reflect on the most defining experience in my life so far: music production
and songwriting.
