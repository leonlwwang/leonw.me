My personal website portfolio blog. Work in progress, version `0.1.0`. :hourglass_flowing_sand:

The stack is **Svelte**, **Astro** for the frontend and **PocketBase** for backend/database &ndash; you could call it a SAP stack! :honey_pot:

All PocketBase really needs to store here are website elements and blog post files so that all the website's elements don't have to live in the repo. May also consider adding a sign-in/account system for commenting on blog posts but this is much later on.

## Instructions

`npm run dev` in the root directory to run the website.

`./content serve` in the `content/` directory to run PocketBase.
