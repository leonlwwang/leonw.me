My personal website portfolio blog. Work in progress, version `0.1.0`. :hourglass_flowing_sand:

The stack is **Svelte**, **Astro** for the frontend and **PocketBase** for backend/database &ndash; you could call it a SAP stack! :honey_pot:

PocketBase was an optimal choice as a flexible backend for a small-scale personal project. All it really needs to store are website elements and blog post files.

**Tailwind CSS** is used for styling frontend components to make the site more active. I have plans to spice up the site by using visual
libraries like **Anime.js** and **Three.js**.

## Instructions

`npm run dev` in the root directory to run the website.

`./content serve` in the `content/` directory to run PocketBase.
