# Portfolio

My personal website portfolio blog. Work in progress, version `0.1.0`. :hourglass_flowing_sand:

The stack is **Svelte**, **Astro** for the frontend and **PocketBase** for the backend &ndash; you could call it a SAP stack :honey_pot:

All PocketBase really needs to store here are website elements and blog post files so that all the website's elements don't have to live inside the repo. May also consider adding a sign-in/account system for commenting on blog posts but this is an idea for a much later time.

I'm also using [**Turbo**](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) for SPA-speed routing.

## Instructions

Make sure the above packages are installed in `npm`.

`npm run dev` to run the website.

`./content serve` in the `content/` directory to run PocketBase.
