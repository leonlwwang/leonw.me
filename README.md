# Portfolio

My personal website portfolio blog. Work in progress, version `0.1.0`. :hourglass_flowing_sand:

The stack is **Svelte**, **Astro** for the frontend and PocketBase for backend/database &ndash; a SAP stack!... :honey_pot:

**Tailwind CSS** is used for styling frontend components to make the site more active. I have plans on using more animation
libraries to spice up the site such as **Three.js** and **Anime.js**.

## Instructions

Install `astro` and `svelte` then run `npm run dev`.

Pocketbase integration and setup is still in the works.
